# Gateway Uplink Stats App - Cisco IR 8XX Series 
Cisco IoT Gateway Stats Microservice - This Golang app provides a HTTP GET API call that returns Cellular Stats for Dual LTE and/or Single LTE and/or WiFi Connected Uplink stats for IR 800 Series Cisco IoT Routers.  It also return GPS data as well. This has a lot of use for tracking connection stats for fail over connectivity or connection activity, even if internet has been disconnected for any reason.

## Working Platforms

This has only been tested on all Cisco IR 829 platforms.  However, it can potentially work with the IR 809 platform as well, but remains untested for now.
